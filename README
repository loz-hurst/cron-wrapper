cron-wrapper
============

Simple bash wrapper that runs a command and suppresses output unless a non-zero exit occurrs, in which case the program's output (stdout and stderr) are sent to stdout.

Purpose to allow commands to be run via cron without generating an email unless a non-zero exit occurrs, in which case output will occur causing cron to send an email.

It is minimally dependent on things that are not routinely installed by design - nothing outside coreutils on most Linux distributions.

Only (non-bash-builtin) dependencies are:
  * mktemp
  * cat
  * rm
